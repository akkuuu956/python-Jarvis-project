# python-Jarvis-project
This Jupyter notebook installs and imports various Python packages to create a voice assistant named Jarvis. Here is an explanation of what each cell is doing:

1. Installs the `datetime` package to work with dates and times

2. Installs the `wikipedia` package to get data from Wikipedia

3. Tries to install `webbrowser` and `os` but fails because those are built-in Python modules, not separate packages

4. Installs `pywhatkit` which has various helper functions like playing YouTube videos

5. Installs `SpeechRecognition` to implement voice commands 

6. Installs `PyAudio` which is a dependency for SpeechRecognition to get mic input

7. Creates the main Jarvis assistant functions:
    - `wishMe()` greets the user based on time of day
    - `takeCommand()` uses SpeechRecognition to listen to mic and convert speech to text
    - `if __name__ == '__main__':` has the main loop that calls wishMe() on start and then waits for voice commands like "open YouTube", "play music", "search on Google". It performs different actions based on the command.

So in summary, it installs necessary packages, imports them, and uses speech recognition along with helper functions to create a voice assistant that can open websites, play media, search Google, etc. based on verbal commands.
